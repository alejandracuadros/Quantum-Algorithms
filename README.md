# Quantum Algorithms

This repository explores various quantum algorithms implemented in Qiskit, covering both foundational and advanced topics. 
These algorithms demonstrate the power of quantum computing in solving problems exponentially faster than classical methods.

## BB84 Protocol Cryptography
* Purpose: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure communication.
* Key Idea: Uses quantum superposition and the no-cloning theorem to detect eavesdropping.

## Random Number Generator
* Purpose: Generate truly random numbers using quantum mechanics.
* Key Idea: Measure qubits in superposition to produce random bitstrings. 

## Quantum Phase Estimation
* Purpose: Estimate the phase of an eigenvalue of a unitary operator.
* Key Idea: Used in Shorâ€™s algorithm and quantum simulations.
